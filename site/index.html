        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The "<a href="#">small web</a>" is a term for the less corporate, more independent side of the Internet -- the personal blogs, organization homepages, passion projects, and so on. The parts that aren't on Facebook, the parts people own themselves.</p>
        <p>Thing is, if you want to have a website like this, there aren't a ton of great options. Self-hosting is, for most people, prohibitively difficult/expensive. Free services, like Github Pages, are good but barebones, and others start free but lock table-stakes features behind "pro" tiers.</p>
        <p>This is ultimately a consequence of these other platforms' business models. They were funded by and built for <i>enterprises</i>, not you.</p>
        <p>I wanted an alternative, so I built one myself! This is Cloudy But No Rain -- a batteries-included, small-tech solution for anything you can stuff into an <code>index.html</code>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>A fast, globally-replicated CDN</b><br/>We use Bunny CDN to host the actual websites. This is great for you, since it means your sites are served from fast SSD storage always located near your visitors, and my servers going down won't mean your site is unavailable.</li>
          <li><b>SSL certificates and DDOS protection</b><br/>including for custom domain names!</li>
          <li><b>Built-in analytics (and soon, monitoring)</b><br/>and because we use server-side access logs for this, it just works out of the box. No need for tracking pixels, 3rd party services, or GDPR cookie-consent banners. Run your site Javascript-free if you want!</li>
          <li><b>A familiar git-based workflow</b><br/>if you've ever used Heroku, you know how nice it is to deploy your code with a simple <code>git push</code>. And if you haven't, it's just a single command from a tool probably already installed on your computer.</li>
          <li><b>Zero big-tech bullshit</b><br/>this was all made by one person (me, Brandon)! I am not Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, and CBNR deliberately avoids using any of their services, at least directly. Sleep better knowing that less of your money is going into the pockets of Jeff Bezos.</li>
