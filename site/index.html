        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The "<a href="#">small web</a>" is a term for the less corporate, more independent side of the Internet -- the personal blogs, organization homepages, passion projects, and so on. The parts that aren't on Facebook, the parts people own themselves.</p>
        <p>Thing is, if you want to have a website like this, there aren't a ton of great options. Self-hosting is, for most people, prohibitively difficult/expensive. Free services, like Github Pages, are good but barebones, and others start free but lock table-stakes features behind "pro" tiers.</p>
        <p>This is ultimately a consequence of these other platforms' business models. They were funded by and built for <i>enterprises</i>, not you.</p>
        <p>I wanted an alternative, so I built one myself! This is Cloudy But No Rain -- a batteries-included, small-tech solution for anything you can stuff into an <code>index.html</code>.</p>

          <summary class="select-none cursor-pointer"><b>A fast, globally-replicated CDN</b></summary>
          <div class="mt-2">The websites of CBNR are served by <a href="#">Bunny.net</a>, via SSDs located all over the world, and folks viewing your website get their copy delivered directly from Bunny. So, your sites are faster and more reliable, and CBNR going down doesn't mean your sites are down too.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary class="select-none cursor-pointer"><b>SSL certificates and DDoS protection</b></summary>
          <div class="mt-2">These are table-stakes features you need to host a site on the public web today, which you get "for free" from our integration with the CDN. This includes SSL certificates for custom domains, which CBNR fully supports.</div>

        <details open="">
          <summary class="select-none cursor-pointer"><b>Built-in analytics (and soon, monitoring)</b></summary>
          <div class="mt-2">Know how popular your site is over time. And because we use server-side access logs for this, it just works out of the box -- no need for tracking pixels, 3rd party services, or GDPR cookie-consent banners. Run your site Javascript-free if you want!</div>

        <details>
          <summary class="select-none cursor-pointer"><b>A familiar Git-based workflow</b></summary>
          <div class="mt-2">If you've ever used Heroku, you know how nice it is to simply <code>git push</code> and see your code deployed. And if you haven't, it's just a single command from a tool probably already installed on your computer.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary class="select-none cursor-pointer"><b>Zero big-tech bullshit</b></summary>
          <div class="mt-2">This was all made by one person (<a href="#">me, Brandon</a>). I am not Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, and CBNR deliberately avoids using any of their services, at least directly. Support a less dystopian future for the Internet!</div>
