          <p>Static websites are awesome!</p>
          <p>They're easy to get started with, cheap to host, and delivering them to folks all over the world is second-to-none in speed and relability.</p>
          <p>But, what's a little less awesome is <b>the infrastructure</b>.</p>
          <p>Big Tech is kinda the Internet's landlord, and if we want our own slice of the web, monopolistic companies are usually the ones getting the rent payment, whether that's in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/">our money</a> or in <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11593727?hl=en">our visitors' privacy</a>.</p>
          <p>I wanted a better platform -- that's built small, and can help enable other sites to be small, too -- without giving a dime to Google or Amazon.</p>
          <p>Thus, <b class="text-[#D08606]">Ecstatic was born</b>! Details below ðŸ‘€</p>

        <h2 class="text-[#b7cb9f]">What Is It?</h2>
          <p>Ecstatic is a platform which <b>hosts static websites</b>. You write some HTML, JS, and whatever else, then use <code class="bg-black">git push</code> to send it to Ecstatic, which puts that content online for you.</p>
          <p>And that content can be anything -- you can create a simple homepage with handwritten HTML, maintain a blog using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">any</a> <a href="https://gohugo.io/">static</a> <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">site</a> <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">generator</a> <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">you</a> <a href="https://astro.build/">want</a>, or even host the frontend for a full-on web application using a JS framework like React.</p>
          <p>This landing page, and the Ecstatic web app, are both <b>hosted on Ecstatic</b>!</p>

        <h2>Important</h2>
        <p>At the moment, Ecstatic Sites is a <b>work in progress</b>.</p>
        <p>If you want to use it, please expect a constantly-shifting user interface, documentation that's missing some pieces around "advanced" features, and even occasional loss of historical analytics data (though I will try my best to avoid this unless it's totally necessary).</p>
        <p>Ecstatic is also <b>free to use</b> while it's in alpha. If you'd like an account, just <a href="mailto:brandon@willett.io">send me an email</a> and I'll get you an invite (this small hurdle is just my attempt to keep misuse to a minimum).</p>
