        <p><b>Remember "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">don't be evil</a>"&thinsp;?</b></p>
        <p>It didn't turn out so great. These days, Big Tech is the Internet's landlord, and if you want your own slice of the web, monopolistic companies like Google are usually the ones getting the rent payment, whether that's in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">your money</a> or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">your visitors' privacy</a>.</p>
        <p>What if you want to host a website that's <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">a little less evil</a>?</p>
        <p>That's what CBNR is for. It's a static site hosting service: you give it a bunch of web pages, and it uploads them to fast servers all over the world. What makes CBNR different is that it's built by and for the <i>independent web</i>, not enterprises -- so it's built small, and helps enable your own sites to be small, too.</p>

        <h2>Important</h2>
        <p>At the moment, Cloudy But No Rain is a <b>work in progress</b>.</p>
        <p>If you want to use it, please expect a constantly-shifting user interface, documentation that's missing some pieces around "advanced" features, and even occasional loss of historical analytics data (though I will try my best to avoid this unless it's totally necessary).</p>
        <p>CBNR is also <b>free to use</b> while it's in alpha. If you'd like an account, just <a href="mailto:brandon@willett.io">send me an email</a> and I'll get you an invite (this small hurdle is just my attempt to keep misuse to a minimum).</p>
