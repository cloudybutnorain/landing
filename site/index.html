        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The "<a href="#">small web</a>" is a term for the less corporate, more independent side of the Internet -- the personal blogs, organization homepages, passion projects, and so on. The parts that aren't on Facebook, the parts people own themselves.</p>
        <p>Thing is, if you want to have a website like this, there aren't a ton of great options. Self-hosting is, for most people, prohibitively difficult/expensive. Free services, like Github Pages, are good but barebones, and others start free but lock table-stakes features behind "pro" tiers.</p>
        <p>This is ultimately a consequence of these other platforms' business models. They were funded by and built for <i>enterprises</i>, not you.</p>
        <p>I wanted an alternative, so I built one myself! This is Cloudy But No Rain -- a batteries-included, small-tech solution for anything you can stuff into an <code>index.html</code>.</p>

        <p>At the moment, Cloudy But No Rain is a <b>work in progress</b>.</p>
        <p>If you want to use it, please expect a constantly-shifting user interface, documentation that's missing some pieces around "advanced" features, and even occasional loss of historical analytics data (though I will try my best to avoid this unless it's totally necessary).</p>
        <p>On the plus side, CBNR is also free to use while it's in development!</p>
